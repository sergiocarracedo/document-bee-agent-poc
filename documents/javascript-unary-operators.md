## What's an operator?

An operator is a symbol that define the operation to do between 1 o more operands.

We use a lot of operators: sum (+), subtraction (-), multiply (\*), division (/), logic and (&&), negation (!),...

## What's a unary operator?

A unary operator is an operator that only needs one operand to work.
For example

```javascript
i++;
```

In this example we have an operand (`i`) and an operator (`++`), we don't need more to increment the `i` variable value.

## Unary operators in Javascript

here is a list with more common unary operators in Javascript

- `++` **Increment**. Increments the value of operand in one unit.
- `--` **Decrement**. Decrements the value of operand in one unit.
- `!` **Logical not**. Negate the boolean operand value.
- `-` **Negation**. Negate the numeric operand value.
- `typeof` Returns the type of the operand in a string.
- `delete` Deletes the index of an array or an object.

## Hacking the system

There is another unary operator that I haven't talked about, the **unary addition** (`+`).

```javascript
let a = 10;
console.log(+a);
```

What do you think will be the result? You probably right: `10`.

So what is this operator for if returns the same value? Here is another example.

```javascript
let a = "10";
console.log(+a);
```

In this one, what do you think will be the result? Yes, it's `10` but not the same `10` we had. **What?**

Replay, but now let's look at the types

```javascript
let a = 10;
console.log(type + a);

let b = "10";
console.log(type + a);
```

Both results are `number`. Here is the point, this operator (tries to) convert the value to number. So we can use it to cast values to `number`.

```javascript
console.log(+"10a"); // NaN
console.log(+"0x10"); // 16
console.log(+"0o10"); // 8
console.log(+"0.1"); // 0.1
console.log(+"1e12"); // 1000000000000
console.log(+"Infinity"); // Infinity
console.log(+undefined); // NaN
console.log(+true); // 1
console.log(+[]); // 0
console.log(+[2]); // 2
console.log(+[2, 3]); // NaN
console.log(+{}); // NaN
console.log(+null); // 0 <= Take care
```

Take care with the last result because it's less obvious

Unary minus do the same, but negate the result.

The `!` operator behaves similarly: It tries to convert the value to `boolean`, but negate the result of the cast, but if we double negate the value we found a way to cast values to `boolean`

```javascript
console.log(!!"10a"); // true
console.log(!!""); // false
console.log(!!0); // false
console.log(!!0); // false
console.log(!!null); // false
console.log(!!undefined); // false
console.log(!!NaN); // false
console.log(!!Infinity); // true
console.log(!!{}); // true <= Take care
console.log(!![]); // true <= Take care
console.log(!!"0"); // false <= Take care
```

I marked the results that for me are counterintuitive

This two unary operators, `+` and `!`, using as `!!` are very useful to cast to number and boolean respectively.

Enjoy them! :wink:
